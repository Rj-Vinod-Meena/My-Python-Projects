# 🐍 Python Data Analysis & Logic Building Portfolio

Welcome to my project repository! Here, I have applied **Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Seaborn** to solve real-world data problems and build logical simulations.

### 📂 Project Details:

#### 1. 🛒 E-commerce Sales Analysis (`ecommerce_analysis.py`)
> **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy
- **Simulation:** Generated a dummy dataset of **100 orders** using NumPy.
- **Logic:** Calculated **Total Revenue** (Price × Quantity) for each order.
- **Analysis:** Grouped data by 'Product' to find the **Best-Selling Products**.
- **Visuals:** Created a Bar Chart using **Seaborn** to visualize product performance.

#### 2. 📊 Student Exam Analysis (`marks_analysis.py`)
> **Tech Stack:** Python, NumPy
- **Matrix Operations:** Used 2D NumPy arrays to store marks of 5 students across 3 subjects.
- **Calculations:** Computed **Total Marks** (axis=1) and **Class Average**.
- **Filtering Logic:** Applied Boolean Masking to filter students who **Passed** (Total > 150).

#### 3. 📈 Weekly Sales Report (`sales_analysis.py`)
> **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Data Handling:** Created a DataFrame to track daily sales and customer count.
- **Insights:** Calculated **Total Weekly Sales** and **Average Customer Footfall**.
- **Graphing:** Plotted a daily sales trend using Matplotlib.

#### 4. 🏧 ATM Banking System (`ATM.py`)
> **Tech Stack:** Core Python (Loops & Conditions)
- **Logic Building:** A simulation of a real ATM machine.
- **Features:** Includes **PIN Authentication**, Balance Check, Withdrawal logic (with validation), and Deposit system.
- **Looping:** Uses `while` loops to keep the menu running until the user chooses to exit.

### 🛠️ Libraries & Tools Used:
- **Core Python:** Logic building, Loops, Conditions.
- **NumPy:** Mathematical operations, Array handling, Random data generation.
- **Pandas:** Dataframes, Grouping, Aggregation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Data Visualization and Graphs.
